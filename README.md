# Trivia Game
Test 2 of your friends to see who knows you best.

Open and run the myquiz.py file on a code server like VS code.

The program will create a game text file once you have typed your 10 personalized questions, answer choices, and answer key in to the program.

You can then replay the game again and again with 2 players. Each player answers 5 questions and the one who gets the most correct knows you the best and is the winner!
